# Food Ordering System using Python & Tkinter


## Problem Statement

In many small restaurants and cafés, the ordering process is still performed manually, which leads to delays, order inaccuracy, and difficulty in calculating the bill. Customers require a simple interface to view food items, select what they want, and place an order without confusion.
This project solves the problem by providing an easy-to-use software system where customers can browse a menu, add items to a cart, view the total price, and place an order.


## Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a desktop-based ordering system providing:

A graphical menu display for available food items.

Ability to add selected items to a cart with quantity update.

Automatic price calculation based on selected items.

Final order confirmation process.


*The project does not include online payment, database storage, or delivery tracking in the current version.*


## Target Users

The system is mainly intended for:

Small restaurants/cafés

College canteens

Fast-food stalls

Food businesses transitioning from manual to digital ordering


End users include:

Customers placing orders

Staff members who receive orders on the system
